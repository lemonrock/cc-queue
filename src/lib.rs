//! # cc-queue
//! A CC Queue, which is:-
//! * Non-blocking
//! * Thread-safe
//! * Concurrent
//! * Unbounded
//! * Faster than the MSQueue (Michael-Scott Queue, as used in Java)
//!
//! And suitable for use with multiple memory allocators, including ones that use persistent memory.
//!
//! ## To use it
//! 1. Create a new instance of `CCQueue`.
//! 2. Create a handle per-thread using `CCQueue.new_per_thread_handle()`.
//! 3. Enqueue and dequeue
//!
//! ## Notes on the API
//! The API may need to change to make it easier to manage the per-thread handle objects.
//!
