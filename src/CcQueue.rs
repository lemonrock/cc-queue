/// This is the cc queue object.
/// It is safe to send references between threads.
/// Each thread accessing the queue should call `new_per_thread_handle`.
/// The queue supports being dropped and all Nodes being freed, however...
/// It does not have any way to free the data owned by the nodes, so a memory leak is quite likely.
/// Instead, it is better to call `clear()` with a callback which can free node data, which requires that there are no `PerQueueThreadHandle` in existence, even for the current thread.
/// Rust's borrow checker should be able to enforce this.
